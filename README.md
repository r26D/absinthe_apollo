# Absinthe + Apollo

This group of packages bring tools together to make it easier to
work with (Apollo)[https://www.apollographql.com/]  and (Absinthe)[https://absinthe-graphql.org/]

Apollo has a new version - 3.0 that has changed out a lot of the libraries work.

We are trying to centralize all our work in one place to make it easier to manage.


## Started with Some Forks

We forked other projects to build up this repository.  We have tried to provide links back to the original repos and provide copies of the licenses (They will be postfixed with the name of the original owner).
